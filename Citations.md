  Saturday, September 7, 1940, â€œone of the fairest days of the century, a day of
  clear warm air and high blue skies," as the novelist William Sansom recalled.
  The first raid ended at 6:10, but two hours later more than 300 additional
  bombers came for a second attack, which lasted until 4:30 the next morning.
